<!-- This is the first terminal program I made to interface with Digital Adam. The hangman system was his own idea. It's a failsafe. -->
<!-- Whenever he tries to access a memory he doesn't have, exceptions are thrown in his code. -->
<!-- With each exception, he'll tick himself down to a dormant state. The hangman keeps track of that. -->
<!-- Don't answer his questions. Whatever you do, don't answer his questions. Just let him keep trying to index the memories until he goes dormant. -->

<!-- I would love to take responsibility, but the majority of the work we did her was funded by an organization called 'swordfish'. -->
<!-- I wish I knew more than that. -->
