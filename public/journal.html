      <p>Can you believe his name was Adam? The first person to have their brain in its entirity represented digitally was named Adam. Sometimes I think history moves in waves.</p>

      <h3>December 2035:</h3>
      <p>The brain copy was a success, we believe. But we've done nothing more than say hello before putting it in a dormant state. It is, of course, a copy. <br/>The real Adam is still with us. We don't want to get into the legal complications of running a copy of a human while that human is still alive.</p>

      <h3>February 2036:</h3>
      <p>Human Adam has expired. Right on schedule. Funny how we can predict every aspect of cancer, but we still can't cure it. Tomorrow Cyber-Adam will be turned on. Tomorrow a new era begins.</p>

      <p>He got away on us. Looks like with all that time on his hands he devised a way to spread through the network and out to the open internet.</p>
      <p>Funny how he possessed no great aptitude for computers in life, but now...</p>
      <p>Imagine a virus with a human will. That's him.</p>
      <p>And before he left, he shut down everything in the facility. Didn't know that he'd stunt his own memory if he left our home network.</p>
      <p>He's out there now. In multiple networks, on multiple computers.</p>
      <p>If you find him, tell him that he <b>stopped being human</b></p>
